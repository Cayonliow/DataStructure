Programming Homework1
	-read the data from the input file
	-the first number in the first row 
	 is the number of size  of the square matrix
	-the row of the matrix is the in vertex 
	-the column of the matrix id the out vertex

	-the early time of the work is found by the recursive function, int early(int vertex_out)
	-using the function to find the earlist time to start work
	-the late time of the work is found by the recursive function, int late(int vertex_out, int vertex_in)
	-using the function to find the lastest time to start work
	-slack time is the difference between the early time and the late time
