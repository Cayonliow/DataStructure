Progamming Homework1
	-there are two types of linked list used to store the sparse matrix
	-structure is used to create the frame of a linked list node
	-union is used to separate two types of linked list 

	-the size of the matrix is first inserted
	-a header node is create and a header node array is dynamically declared
	-the whole matrix is then inserted 
	-the position of the non-zero element is recorded 
	 and the value of the element is pointed to the corresponding header node array
	-the whole linked list is linked together circularly

	-the two linked list are multiplied together and the result is stored 
	 into a new linked list using the method above 
	-a pointer is used to search the non-zero element
	-a pointer will point to next when it found one element and will stop 
	 when it point back to the first header node of that link

	-the position of the non-zero element is recorded
	 and the value of the element is pointed to the corresponding header node array
	-the whole linked list is linked together circularly

	-the value of the row anf column of the position of the element are inverted
	-a pointer is used to search the non-zero element
	-if discovered the row and column of the non-zero element is not arranged
	 so the missing position is 0 and print out 0
