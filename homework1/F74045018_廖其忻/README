Data Structure Assignment 1
Programming Homework

Homework 1
	-the recursive part is done with the function 
	 which is return when the times of the terms multiplying
	 is equal to the value of the terms
	-the next term multipled will be decreased by 1
	
	-the iterative part is done in the main function 
	by multiplying the next term within the while loop
	and break when the times of the terms multiplying 
	is equal to the value of the terms
	-the next term multipled will be decreased by 1

Homework2
	-the program is completed by using recursion

	-there are 2 functions included in the program
		-void find(int level, int index, int n, int N)
			-level=the number of searching
			-index=how many elements wanted 
			-n=the number of level wanted to be searched
			-N=total elements included

			-using the concept of combination
			-total powersets is equal to 2^n where n
			 is the number of elements

		-void recursive(int n)
			-n=total elements included

			-search the powersets according to the number 
			 of elements needed in ascending order by using 
			 foor loop
